I have completed the coursework for the experimental master's program at ANU’s new 3A Institute. It’s been two weeks and 
I think I can start making sense of it -- the material is still fresh in my head but the details of a frenzied semester of 
completing projects and reading are receding. A perfect time for abstraction [^1].

## 1. What's New?

3AI aims to establish a *new* branch of engineering. What could *new* possibly mean? Engineering as practiced today is carved up according to the object it seeks to engineer. A mechanical engineer seeks to design and create machines. 
An electrical engineer seeks to design and create electrical devices. And in a rare violation of boundaries, mechatronics engineer seeks to design and create electro-mechanical devices. 3AI offers: the new branch of engineering (NBE) seeks to engineer cyber-physical systems (CPS). CPS’s are best defined by what they do rather than what they are. They sense the world, infer from the sensory data, and act (usually independently) to change something in the world. Temperature-sensing AC is a simple example. A self-driving car is a more provoking one. So, does the *new* in NBE simply mean contending with newer and emerging category of technological objects in the world? Partly, yes. But I think the most interesting part of NBE is not the CPS’s themselves but the philosophical engagement with the ideas around engineering that CPS’s *demand.*

An aside first: engineering's paltry engagement with the humanities has been noted multiple times, and in some cases identified as the grand challenge of engineering. The occasional inclusion of the liberal arts in an engineering curriculum is motivated by the mundane argument that it helps engineers to communicate effectively. Building, in and of itself, reigns supreme. And question such as what are the benefits, and who benefits is relegated to the vacuum. This is not necessarily universal, but it is typical enough that one can justify generalizing. In short, it lacks reflections and examinations. 
And to borrow from Socrates, maybe unexamined engineering is not worth doing.

We can no longer afford such a frivolous way of engineering. It is easy to agree that engineering should be for the 
benefit of the humankind. It is hard to understand what that entails. 3Ai offers one possible answer: in addition to 
the usual benefit of fulfilling some functional objectives, it must also be **safe**, **responsible**, and **sustainable**. 
But why is it especially pertinent to care about this *now*? It is pertinent because we are witnessing an introduction of an 
entirely new class of technological objects into the world. This new class of object is increasingly imbued with intent and 
autonomy to follow through on that intent. They are bleeding away from the realm of tools into becoming agents in their own 
right. 3Ai has named them cyber-physical systems. It is important to seriously examine and question the meaning of these terms 
because of the existing cursory use of words such as safe, responsible, and sustainable fall woefully short in case of CPS’s. 
Safe can no longer just mean machines that don’t randomly blow up, it also has to mean self-driving cars navigating uncharted 
difficult driving circumstances. Responsible can no longer just mean seeking legal shield from regulatory bodies but also has 
to mean anticipating harms and avoiding them. Sustainable can no longer just mean using recyclable material but also 
has to mean creating lasting co-habitation of the object with the world. I think this *new* engagement with the moral 
and existential questions surrounding engineering that creating beneficial CPS’s demand is what’s truly *new* with the NBE.

## 2. Taking Things Seriously

Now, I think one can question the choice of safe, sustainable, and responsible, but that is almost beside the point. What is novel and important is the engagement with the question of what kind of engineering we want. Safe, Sustainable and Responsible are all properties that we want in engineering, especially in one that deals with CPS’s. By assigning a set of mandates, 3Ai has shifted the debate from the abstract to the operationable.

But philosophical lingering remains a curiosity at 3Ai. After all, it is an engineering institute, and one ran by industry veterans who prize the real and the practical. So, 3Ai goes one step further. In addition to considering a safe, sustainable, and responsible engineering, the institute will consider it with a particular set of ideas: agency, autonomy, assurance, intent, interface, and indicators. These make up the so-called vectors of the institute. The selection of these ideas and the reason behind it is one of the main lingering questions I still have even after almost a year at the institute. Still, I have found these ideas enormously useful in one particular way. They form a class of heuristics, especially once you get used to them, to get to important questions and design considerations surrounding safe, sustainable, and responsible 
engineering. Creating categories has been one of the most successful ideas in sciences and engineering, and so it is only understandable that 3Ai would use them to tackle such enormously challenging concept such as safety, responsibility, and sustainability.

## 3. A Touch of Cybernetics
Finally, there is one more element to 3Ai’s philosophical engagement with engineering: cybernetics. There is much that is interesting and much that can be said about it. But the central ideas that 3Ai borrows is that of non-duality. In face of the dualistic nature of sciences and engineering (human and the world, machine and the world), cybernetics is a holistic 
theory (human in the world, machine in the world) that attempts to take, to use the term that has been co-opted close to meaninglessness, a *systems* approach. Why is it necessary though? We have produced buildings, planes, and other marvels by simply approximating the world with a dualistic theory. It is necessary because CPS’s are complex in the way that engineering objects were not. CPS’s are much more *functionally* complex. A car used to be engineered for deterministic and simple function: move forward when an accelerator is pressed, turn when the steering wheel is turned, slow down when braked. 
The critical interaction is between the driver and the car. A self-driving car meanwhile is engineered to see the world, understand it in its complexity and diversity, understand the laws and decision-making that comes with driving and then finally, actually drive. The interactions are multiple order more complex and the dualistic approximation is no longer useful. In fact, such an approach might be actively harmful. Indeed, a philosophy of engineering cannot be built on an approximation of the world. If we want to engineer truly beneficial systems, we cannot afford the luxury of idealistic approximations. We have to engineer in the world as it *is.*
